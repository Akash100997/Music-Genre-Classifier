# Music-Genre-Classifier 



In this project, we will use the dataset provided by "https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification" to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network for classifying the Music Genres.

Steps to be followed:

1. Download and Unzip the dataset provied in the URL above.
2. We need to preprocess the dataset. Which means we have to extract the feautres(MFCC) of the different music genres(Blues, Rock, Metal, Jazz, Disco, etc..) and label it accordingly.
3. Store the MFCC features in a json file.
4. Load and split the Dataset to Train , Test and Validation.
5. Build the model.
6. Compile the model.
7. Train the Model and evalute.
8. Inference/ Prediction is done on the trained model.
